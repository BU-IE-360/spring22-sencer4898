A regression approach combined with a time-series model was the first proposition to be used by the group. The data set consisted of hourly production values and weather conditions of the given hours. The data set was in long format, maditr package’s dcast function was used to convert the data to wide format."

    "There remains one last problem with the target variable after the manipulations given above are applied. The facility was not operating with the full capacity at the time horizon of interest. It is likely that there were additional installations of solar panels/ or some maintenance done during some times that they would cause an unexplainable step drop or increase in the observed production values. A smoothing should be applied to get a picture of the true level at a specific time in the time horizon. A moving average method with parameter k=21 is used which added a column to the data to indicate the production capacity as a variable. 10 days after and before values with the center value is used with an average with equal weights so that one could obtain a clear and unbiased variable for the true production level at that time. The maximum of 21 days and k=11 days period is also evaluated for usage however k=21 average for center value yielded the best results for explaining the production level overall. Thus, k=21 center moving average smoothing is used. The first 10 and last 10 days have no variable due to the fact that they do not have 10 days ahead of them so the first obtained and last obtained value is duplicated. It has been assumed that they provide the least biased information regarding the capacity. "

    "The solar panel production does not necessarily display a monthly or quarterly seasonality but there was an hourly seasonality during the day. Although the seasons affect the production during a specific hour due to the change in the sunrise, sunset times and the angular degree of the sunlight rays hitting the panels. The data set was not providing a system with stable state but rather it was a system with transient states. Therefore, the evaluation was much harder due to the lack of data with stationarity. "

    "Original time series data consist of hourly production values for dates from 2021-02-01 to two days before current date. Analyzing the data, we can see that there is an upper limit for the production values, of which production values cannot exceed. Construction of the production facility started in beginning of 2021. For this reason, capacity is small at the beginning of the data and increasing constantly until June 2021. Then, it is constant for some time around 40KWp. It decreases to 35KWp in the beginning of 2022 and stays on that level since (until recently). This maximum capacity change is a significant problem to deal with because linear regression works in an additive manner and it will find the optimal coefficients for an assumed maximum capacity, which will not work well with capacity change."

    "For hours from 6 to 19, a different model is established for each hour. Considering the historical data, the production of all the remaining hours is considered to be zero. The grid search method is used to determine the parameters to be used in each model. \"Set.seed(500)\" is used in each grid search to get the same values in each attempt. 4 different weather variables are provided in the data for each of the 9 coordinates. This will make 9 coordinates multiplied with 4 variables, 36 weather variables. When we try to set up a linear model with these weather variables, using more than 2 location values of the same variable disturbs the model. The coefficients of the same variable can appear in opposite signs for different locations. That's why the maximum 2 coordinate values of the same weather variable are evaluated when doing a grid search. Since a separate model was established for each hour, a separate grid search is performed for all the parameters to be used for each hour. 1000 different models using different weather variable combinations are compared according to weighted mean absolute percentage errors and the variables giving the minimum WMAPE are selected for use in the model.

    "The temperature and production variables’ interaction were peculiar in the sense that increasing temperature values up to a certain threshold would increase production however after a certain threshold excessive heat would deteriorate the production. One could say that after a specific value, not known, the production was affected negatively. Therefore, to evaluate the non-linear relation the square of temperature variable is added as a column, and the highest R squared value is searched. The absolute value of the residuals that are above a certain threshold’s correlation with the temperature variable is analyzed and it is seen that they have a negative correlation. Which means that increasing temperature decreases the residuals or increases the predicted value but it deviates from the real value (the residual is far away from 0, or its mean). Also decreasing temperature decreases the prediction greatly so that the bias increases."

    "For evaluating the models, multiple metrics have been used in order to detect and attack distinct aspects of the model. Also, the evaluation metrics have been collected for a period of 30 days while training the model again with the additional one day at each step. Therefore, one could say that the training set has been increased by one day after each evaluation,addition of one more hour to each model, and total bias, absolute bias as well as weighted mean absolute deviation have been used for interpretation of the models. For instance, total bias could be 0 which means the test period overall had a close mean value when compared to the predictions however absolute bias could be very high which shows the variance has been estimated inaccurately. Data is overall on the same level as the predictions but they are distinctively apart from fitting onto each other. Weighted mean absolute deviation is a better metric for evaluating the model performances since it is not affected by small values and is scale free. However, total bias and mean absolute bias could also be used to scale the deviation of different hours’ values which would indicate the work to be committed for the different models in order to obtain the most efficient results. As an example, if the model for hour 7 is returning an absolute bias of 250 in contrast if the model for hour 9 is returning an absolute bias of 25 then an improvement in model for hour 7 is going to decrease the overall wmape more.

    "From the metrics above, one could argue that the hour 10,12,13 and 16’s models are providing biased estimates. Also, hour 7’s model is problematic in the sense that it is capturing the overall level but it deviates from the mean gigantically. The same is true for hour 15 and 17’s models. The problem here is that we have evaluated the models based on the hourly period therefore scales are not removed. From the table above, one could see that WMAPE of hour 19 is 0.2446 whereas its total absolute bias is 5.69. The model for hour 19 has larger WMAPE than the model for hour 14 which has 152 Total Absolute Bias. Therefore, here scale is not removed and WMAPE provides some statistics even if it is not as explanatory as the other two metrics. Total Absolute and Total Bias provide one with meaningful ways that model could be improved through."
