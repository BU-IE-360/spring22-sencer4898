    "There remains one last problem with the target variable after the manipulations given above are applied. The facility was not operating with the full capacity at the time horizon of interest. It is likely that there were additional installations of solar panels/ or some maintenance done during some times that they would cause an unexplainable step drop or increase in the observed production values. A smoothing should be applied to get a picture of the true level at a specific time in the time horizon. A moving average method with parameter k=21 is used which added a column to the data to indicate the production capacity as a variable. 10 days after and before values with the center value is used with an average with equal weights so that one could obtain a clear and unbiased variable for the true production level at that time. The maximum of 21 days and k=11 days period is also evaluated for usage however k=21 average for center value yielded the best results for explaining the production level overall. Thus, k=21 center moving average smoothing is used. The first 10 and last 10 days have no variable due to the fact that they do not have 10 days ahead of them so the first obtained and last obtained value is duplicated. It has been assumed that they provide the least biased information regarding the capacity. "

Analyzing the data, we can see that there is an upper limit for the production values, of which production values cannot exceed. Construction of the production facility started in beginning of 2021. For this reason, capacity is small at the beginning of the data and increasing constantly until June 2021. Then, it is constant for some time around 40KWp. It decreases to 35KWp in the beginning of 2022 and stays on that level since (until recently).

However, if the output is heavily affected by the externalities, time series analysis approaches are not enough themselves and regression based approaches are required. Solar energy production data does not have seasonalities similar to a daily gross sales data of a retail company, which has strong weekly and monthly seasonalities. Solar data has somewhat hourly seasonality. It is heavily affected by external variables, such as cloud low layer and DSWRF. For these reasons, we decided to apply linear regression for forecasting to catch effects of externalities. We prepared models for each hour to catch seasonal patterns of each hour.

The coefficients of the same variable can appear in opposite signs for different locations. That's why the maximum 2 coordinate values of the same weather variable are evaluated when doing a simulation. Since a separate model was established for each hour, a separate simulation is performed for all the parameters to be used for each hour. 1000 different models using randomly selected weather variable combinations are compared according to weighted mean absolute percentage errors and the variables giving the minimum WMAPE are selected for use in the model.

The absolute value of the residuals that are above a certain threshold’s correlation with the temperature variable is analyzed and it is seen that they have a negative correlation.

Therefore, one could say that the training set has been increased by one day after each evaluation,addition of one more hour to each model, and total bias, absolute bias as well as weighted mean absolute deviation have been used for interpretation of the models. For instance, total bias could be 0 which means the test period overall had a close mean value when compared to the predictions however absolute bias could be very high which shows the variance has been estimated inaccurately. Data is overall on the same level as the predictions but they are distinctively apart from fitting onto each other. Weighted mean absolute deviation is a better metric for evaluating the model performances since it is not affected by small values and is scale free. However, total bias and mean absolute bias could also be used to scale the deviation of different hours’ values which would indicate the work to be committed for the different models in order to obtain the most efficient results.

    "As a result of our work, we found that the most important variable for each model turned out to be the smoothed production. This is because recent production values are correlated to tomorrow's production values, and it is unlikely that tomorrow will have drastically different values from the near past. Other predictors were expected to be very important, however they turned out to be not that important. This is probably because their effect is more complex and not easy to interpret."

    "There could be some other methods and techniques that could yield better or worse results, a trial and error process could be conducted to expose a better approach. There are many things that can be improved by using larger data and different predictors. In order to develop the model, the effects of variables on real-life electricity production can be investigated and variable values could be used in different combinations and with different formulas.\n"
